# Tech Blog

This is my personal tech blog where I share my thoughts, ideas, and experiences related to software development and technology in general.

I built this blog using [Astro](https://astro.build/), a modern web framework for building fast, scalable, and secure websites. The styling is handled by [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), a utility-first CSS framework that makes it easy to create custom user interfaces.

## Posts

I will be posting about my experiences with software development, my thoughts on technology trends, and my own projects. The posts will be organized by categories and tags, making it easy to find related content.

## Contributing

If you want to contribute to the blog, please feel free to create an issue or pull request on GitHub. I appreciate any help with proofreading, grammar, or suggestions for new topics.
